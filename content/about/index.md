I ride bikes for fun. I play with Linux and computers for fun and profit. This blog is mainly about what I do for fun, or stuff I need to remember to keep making profit.

This site is built with Hugo using Github Actions and hosted on Github Pages.

The theme used here is [Yacht](https://github.com/ccwoof/yacht) (Yet another console-inspired Hugo theme), made by myself but heavily inspired by Joe Roe's excellent [Risotto](https://github.com/joeroe/risotto) theme.
